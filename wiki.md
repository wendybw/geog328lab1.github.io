Edinburgh is the capital city of Scotland. It is the *second-largest* financial center in the United Kingdom, *fourth largest* in Europe and *thirteenth largest* internationally. Its historical and cultural attractions have made it the UK's *second-most* visited tourist destination. In 2022, it was rate the best city in the world by Time Out.[1][2]

## Geography
Edinburgh is situated in Scotland's **Central Belt**. The city centre is 2.5 mi southwest of the shoreline of Leith and 26 mi inland, as the crow flies, from the east coast of Scotland and the North Sea at Dunbar.[3] While the early burgh grew up near the prominent Castle Rock, the modern city is often said to be built on seven hills. Like most of Scotland, Edinburgh has a cool, temperate, maritime climate.[4]

## Economy
In the 19th century, Edinburgh's economy was known for banking and insurance, publishing and printing, and brewing and distilling. Today, its economy is based mainly on financial services, scientific research, higher education, and tourism.[5]
Tourism is also an important element in the city's economy. As a World Heritage Site, tourists visit historical sites such as Edinburgh Castle, the Palace of Holyroodhouse and the Old and New Towns. Their numbers are augmented in August each year during the Edinburgh Festivals, which attracts 4.4 million visitors, and generates over £100M for the local economy.[6]

## Culture
### Edinburgh festival
The city hosts a series of festivals that run between the end of July and early September each year. The best known of these events are the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the Edinburgh International Festival, the Edinburgh Military Tattoo, the Edinburgh Art Festival and the Edinburgh International Book Festival.[7]
### Music
Edinburgh has a healthy popular music scene. Occasionally large concerts are staged at Murrayfield and Meadowbank, while mid-sized events take place at smaller venues such as 'The Corn Exchange', 'The Liquid Rooms' and 'The Bongo Club'. In 2010, PRS for Music listed Edinburgh among the UK's top ten 'most musical' cities.[8]
